# Error Visualization for Quantum Information

![Quantum Error Visualization](quantum-error-viz.png)

This project provides an interactive visualization of error analysis in a quantum communication system. It models the probability density functions (PDFs) of two Gaussian-distributed signals (representing logical -1 and 1), computes the overlap area between them, and estimates error probabilities (bit flips) and erasure probabilities based on a configurable threshold.

## üßÆ Mathematical Description

### 1. Gaussian Probability Density Functions

For the two signals, the Gaussian PDFs are defined as:

$$
f_1(x) = A_1 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_1} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}\right)
$$

$$
f_2(x) = A_2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_2} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2}\right)
$$

Where:

- $A_1, A_2$ ‚Äî amplitudes  
- $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ ‚Äî standard deviations  
- $\mu_1 = -1$, $\mu_2 = 1$ ‚Äî means (fixed)

### 2. Overlap Area

The overlap between two PDFs is defined as:

$$
\text{Overlap Area} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \min\left\{ f_1(x), f_2(x) \right\} \, dx
$$


This integral is numerically approximated using the trapezoidal rule.

### 3. Error and Erasure Probabilities

- **Bit Flip (Error) Probability** $P_e$:

$$
P_e = \int_{\tau}^{\infty} f_1(x) dx + \int_{-\infty}^{-\tau} f_2(x) dx
$$

- **Erasure Probability** $P_c$:

$$
P_c = \int_{-\tau}^{\tau} f_1(x) dx + \int_{-\tau}^{\tau} f_2(x) dx
$$

## üß† How It Works (High-Level Summary)

- The tool simulates two Gaussian-distributed signals.
- You can tune their variances and amplitudes.
- The system calculates where they overlap.
- It estimates:
  - When signals are misclassified ($P_e$),
  - When the system cannot confidently decide ($P_c$).
- You can explore this through different interactive visualization modes.
